This project is part of a cumulative assignment to build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for managing a school database. The focus is on the Teachers table, using ASP.NET Core Web API and MVC. In Part 2, we implement the functionality to add and delete teachers through both API endpoints and server-rendered web pages.

The final product allows users to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on the Teachers table with a focus on server-side rendering and API interactions.
